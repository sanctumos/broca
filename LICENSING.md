# Licensing Information

## Overview

This project uses **dual licensing** to provide appropriate terms for different types of content:

- **Source Code**: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)
- **Documentation & Data**: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

## Source Code License: AGPLv3

All source code files (`.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, etc.) are licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**.

### What AGPLv3 Means

**AGPLv3** is a strong copyleft license that ensures:
- **Freedom to use**: You can run the software for any purpose
- **Freedom to study**: You can examine how the software works
- **Freedom to modify**: You can change the software to suit your needs
- **Freedom to distribute**: You can share the software with others
- **Network use triggers distribution**: If you run modified versions on a server, you must provide source code to users

### Key Requirements

1. **Source Code Availability**: If you modify and distribute the software, you must provide the complete source code
2. **Network Use**: If you run a modified version on a server that users interact with, you must provide source code to those users
3. **License Preservation**: Any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3
4. **Attribution**: You must preserve copyright notices and license information

### When AGPLv3 Applies

- All Python source code files
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS files
- Configuration files that are part of the software
- Build scripts and automation tools
- Any executable code or scripts

## Documentation & Data License: CC-BY-SA 4.0

All documentation, data schemas, examples, and non-code content are licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International**.

### What CC-BY-SA 4.0 Means

**CC-BY-SA 4.0** allows you to:
- **Share**: Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- **Adapt**: Remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially

**Under these conditions**:
- **Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made
- **ShareAlike**: If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license

### When CC-BY-SA 4.0 Applies

- Markdown documentation files (`.md`)
- Text files (`.txt`)
- Configuration examples
- Data schemas and examples
- User guides and tutorials
- API documentation
- README files
- Changelog files

## Dual Licensing Benefits

This dual licensing approach provides:

1. **Strong Software Freedom**: AGPLv3 ensures the software remains free and open
2. **Flexible Content Sharing**: CC-BY-SA 4.0 allows easy sharing and adaptation of documentation
3. **Clear Separation**: Easy to understand which license applies to which content
4. **Community Friendly**: Encourages contributions while protecting software freedoms

## Compliance Requirements

### For Source Code (AGPLv3)

- Include the full license text in your distribution
- Provide source code when distributing modified versions
- Preserve copyright notices and license headers
- License derivative works under AGPLv3
- Provide source code access for network users if applicable

### For Documentation (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

- Attribute the original work appropriately
- Include a link to the license
- Indicate any changes made
- License derivative works under CC-BY-SA 4.0

## File Classification Examples

### AGPLv3 (Source Code)
```
main.py

```

## Getting Help

If you have questions about licensing:

1. **Source Code Questions**: Review the [AGPLv3 license text](LICENSE)
2. **Documentation Questions**: Review the [CC-BY-SA 4.0 license text](LICENSE-DOCS)
3. **General Questions**: Check the [project documentation](../../docs/)
4. **Legal Questions**: Consult with a legal professional familiar with open source licensing

## License Headers

Source code files include license headers like this:

```python
"""
