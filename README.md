# Sanctum: Broca 2 (v0.9.0)

A CLI-first, plugin-based message processing system for agent communication.

## 🚀 Overview

Sanctum: Broca 2 is a refactored version of Broca, focusing on:
- CLI-first architecture for better control and automation
- Plugin-based system for extensible message handling
- Clean separation between core and platform-specific code
- Improved maintainability and testing capabilities

## Broca: The Middleware Bridge

Sanctum: Broca 2 serves as middleware designed to bridge the Letta Agentic Framework with various communication endpoints. Just as Broca's area in the human brain is responsible for language production and speech, Sanctum: Broca 2 acts as the "speech center" for AI systems—translating agent intentions into actionable messages across different platforms.

In the AI brain, Sanctum: Broca 2 plays a crucial role by:
- **Translating Agent Intentions:** Converting high-level agent decisions into platform-specific messages.
- **Unifying Communication:** Providing a standardized interface for different endpoints (Telegram, CLI, APIs, etc.).
- **Enabling Extensibility:** Allowing new endpoints to be integrated seamlessly through the plugin system.

This middleware approach ensures that the Letta Agentic Framework can focus on decision-making and intelligence, while Sanctum: Broca 2 handles the complexities of communication and integration.

### Plugin Structure
```python
from plugins import Plugin

class MyPlugin(Plugin):
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        return "my_plugin"
    
    def get_platform(self) -> str:
        return "my_platform"
    
    def get_message_handler(self) -> Callable:
        return self._handle_message
    
    async def start(self) -> None:
        # Initialize plugin
        
    async def stop(self) -> None:
        # Cleanup plugin
```

### Required Methods

## 🤖 Agent/MCP-Ready Design

Sanctum: Broca 2 is built so that all CLI tools and plugin interfaces are **MCP'able** (machine-controllable by agents):
- Every CLI and admin tool is scriptable and can be operated by other AI agents or automation systems.
- All commands support machine-friendly output (e.g., JSON) and error handling.
- This enables Sanctum: Broca 2 to be embedded in agent networks, automated test harnesses, or orchestration systems.
- When extending Sanctum: Broca 2, always consider both human and agent/automation use cases.

## 🔮 Planned Updates

### Multi-Agent Architecture
Sanctum: Broca 2 will support multiple Letta agents through a simple, efficient architecture:
- Each agent will run in its own Broca instance
- Instances will share a common virtual environment to minimize resource usage
- Simple git-based update system that preserves agent-specific configurations
- Clear 1:1 mapping between Broca instances and Letta agents

### Broca MCP Server
A new Management Control Panel server will be added to manage multiple Broca instances:
- Instance Management: Deploy, monitor, and update Broca instances
- Agent Configuration: Manage Letta agent credentials and settings
- Monitoring & Logging: Centralized logging and performance metrics
- Resource Management: Monitor shared resources and system health
- Security: Centralized credential management and access control
