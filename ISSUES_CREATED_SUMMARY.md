## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Repository Owner)
1. **Create Labels**: Add the labels listed above to organize issues properly
2. **Review Issues**: Go through each issue and add appropriate labels
3. **Assign Team Members**: Distribute issues to team members based on expertise
4. **Create Milestones**: Consider creating milestones for different priority levels

### Development Team Actions
1. **Prioritize Work**: Start with high-priority security issues (#2-#4)
