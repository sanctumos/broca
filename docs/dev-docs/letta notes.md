# Letta Notes

### Python SDK

<Note>
The legacy Letta Python `LocalClient`/`RestClient` SDK is available under `pip install letta` (which also contains the server).
This client is deprecated and will be replaced in a future release with the new `letta-client`.
Please migrate any Python code using the old `RESTClient` or `LocalClient` to use `letta-client` to avoid breaking changes in the future.
</Note>

The Letta [Python SDK](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-python) can be downloaded with:
```bash
pip install letta-client
```

Once installed, you can instantiate the client in your Python code with:
```python
from letta_client import Letta

# connect to a local server
client = Letta(base_url="http://localhost:8283")

# connect to Letta Cloud
client = Letta(token="LETTA_API_KEY")
```

(( our server is not localhost. We'll be connecting to a VPS server.

https://your-letta-server.com:8283
pw YOUR_PASSWORD <- configure this in your environment

We'll want to configure this in the admin dashboard settings.

))

### Development Notes

#### Identity Management
- Identities must be explicitly specified as "user" type when creating them
- User context is not automatically maintained between messages - each message must include the identity_id
- Core memory blocks should be attached to user identities to maintain context
- When sending messages, always include the identity_id parameter to maintain conversation context

Example identity creation:
```python
# Create a user identity
identity = {
    "identifier_key": "user_123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "identity_type": "user"  # Important: must specify as "user"
}
```

Example message with identity:
```python
client.agents.messages.create(
    agent_id="agent_id",
    messages=[MessageCreate(role="user", content="Hello")],
    identity_id="user_123"  # Include identity_id to maintain context
)
```

#### Core Block Management
- Each user identity should have an associated core memory block named `Persona_<username>`
- The core block should be created when the identity is created
- The core block should be attached to the identity as a variable
- Message flow:
  1. Create the block using `client.blocks.create()`
  2. Attach the user's `Persona_<username>` core block to the agent
  3. Send the message with the user's identity_id
  4. Detach the user's core block from the agent
- This ensures the agent has access to the user's persona information during the conversation
- Core blocks should contain relevant user information, preferences, and conversation history

#### CRITICAL: Block ID Management
- The `client.blocks.list()` operation is currently unreliable and may not show all blocks
- This is a known issue being investigated by the core team
- **DESIGN REQUIREMENT**: All block IDs must be cached locally
- Block IDs should be stored in the database alongside user records
- Never rely on `client.blocks.list()` for block discovery or management

Implementation Details:
```python
# Create a new block
block = client.blocks.create(
    label=f"Persona_{username}",
    value={
        "name": username,
        "preferences": {},
        "conversation_history": []
    }
)

# Store block ID in database
user_record.block_id = block.id
user_record.save()

# Core block operations (using cached block ID)
client.blocks.retrieve(block_id=user_record.block_id)
client.blocks.modify(block_id=user_record.block_id, value=new_content)
client.agents.blocks.attach(agent_id=agent_id, block_id=user_record.block_id)
client.agents.blocks.detach(agent_id=agent_id, block_id=user_record.block_id)

# NEVER use list() for block discovery
# client.blocks.list()  # DO NOT USE - unreliable
```

Example Usage:
```python
# Create and manage a user's persona block
block_label = f"Persona_{username}"
block_content = {
    "name": username,
    "preferences": {},
    "conversation_history": []
}

# Create the block first
block = client.blocks.create(
    label=block_label,
    value=block_content
)

# Store block ID in database
user_record.block_id = block.id
user_record.save()

# Attach block before sending message
client.agents.blocks.attach(agent_id=agent_id, block_id=user_record.block_id)
try:
    # Send message with identity
    response = client.agents.messages.create(
        agent_id=agent_id,
        messages=[MessageCreate(role="user", content=message)],
        identity_id=identity_id
    )
finally:
    # Always detach block after message
    client.agents.blocks.detach(agent_id=agent_id, block_id=user_record.block_id)
```

IDENTITY STUFF: We'll use this to attach to Person records in the DB - it keeps the different conversations and memory blocks seperate.

For some reason it doesn't seem to be (yet) supported by the SDK, so we'll need to write our own library for managing identity.

curl http://localhost:8283/v1/identities/ \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8283/v1/identities/ \

  "identifier_key": "identifier_key",
  "name": "name",
  "identity_type": "org"
}'

Upsert Identity
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8283/v1/identities/ \

NOTE - List Blocks MAY not list all blocks. Seems buggy. Core team is looking into it.
