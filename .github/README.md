# GitHub Issues Management

This directory contains files for managing GitHub issues based on the comprehensive codebase audit.

## Files

### 📋 ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md
Complete list of 16 structured issues based on the audit recommendations. This file contains:
- Detailed issue descriptions
- Priority classifications
- Implementation details
- File references
- Labels for organization

### 🚀 create_audit_issues.sh
Automated script to create all audit issues using GitHub CLI. This script will:
- Check GitHub CLI authentication
- Verify that issues are enabled on the repository
- Create all 16 issues with proper labels and descriptions
- Provide a summary of created issues

## How to Use

### Method 1: Manual Issue Creation
1. Enable issues on the repository (requires admin permissions)
2. Open `ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`
3. Copy each issue section and create individual GitHub issues
4. Use the suggested labels for proper organization

### Method 2: Automated Issue Creation
1. Ensure GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. Enable issues on the repository (requires admin permissions)

3. Run the automated script:
   ```bash
   ./.github/create_audit_issues.sh
   ```

## Labels to Create

Before creating issues, set up these labels in your repository:

| Label | Color | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `security` | Red | Security-related issues |
| `high-priority` | Red | High priority items |
| `medium-priority` | Orange | Medium priority items |
| `low-priority` | Green | Low priority items |
| `architecture` | Blue | Architecture improvements |
| `testing` | Purple | Testing-related issues |
| `performance` | Yellow | Performance optimizations |
| `devops` | Gray | DevOps and deployment |
| `documentation` | Light Blue | Documentation improvements |
| `code-quality` | Pink | Code quality improvements |

## Repository Status

**Current Status:** Issues are disabled on the `sanctumos/broca` repository.

**Required Action:** A repository administrator needs to enable issues before the automated script can be used.

**Alternative:** Use the manual method with `ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md` until issues are enabled.

## Implementation Priority

Based on the audit, we recommend implementing in this order:

1. **Security Issues First** - Address credential management and API key exposure
2. **CI/CD Setup** - Enable automated testing and quality gates
3. **Test Coverage** - Implement comprehensive testing
4. **Configuration Management** - Unify configuration system
5. **Performance Optimizations** - Database pooling and concurrency
6. **Code Quality** - Type annotations and duplication reduction
7. **DevOps Features** - Containerization and monitoring
