## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### üîí Security Issues

#### Issue #1: Create .env.example template and improve credential management
**Labels:** `security`, `high-priority`, `documentation`

**Description:**
Missing .env.example file creates security risk where developers may commit real credentials to the repository.

**Issues Identified:**
- No .env.example template for developers
- Risk of credential exposure in commits
- Missing environment variable validation on startup

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Create .env.example with placeholder values for all required environment variables
- [ ] Ensure .env is in .gitignore
- [ ] Implement environment variable validation on startup
- [ ] Add documentation about proper credential management

**Implementation Details:**
Create a validation function in main.py to check for test/placeholder values in production.

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- .env.example (new)
- main.py (add validation)
- docs/configuration.md (update documentation)

**Audit Reference:** AUDIT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Security Recommendations #1

#### Issue #2: Remove API key exposure in logs
**Labels:** `security`, `high-priority`, `logging`

**Description:**
API keys may be partially exposed in debug logs, creating security vulnerabilities.

**Current Issue:**
```python
# Found in runtime/core/letta_client.py:23
logger.debug(f"Using API key: {self.api_key[:4]}...")
```

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Remove API key logging entirely in production
- [ ] Implement secure logging levels that exclude sensitive data
- [ ] Add configuration option to control sensitive data logging
- [ ] Review all logging statements for potential credential exposure

**Files to Modify:**
- runtime/core/letta_client.py

**Description:**
While using SQLAlchemy, some raw SQL queries were found that could pose security risks.

**Current Issues:**
- Raw SQL queries in database operations
- Need for consistent parameterized query usage
- Missing input validation for database operations

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Review all database operations for SQL injection risks
- [ ] Ensure parameterized queries are used consistently
- [ ] Add input validation for all database operations

    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: str = None, recovery_hint: str = None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.error_code = error_code
        self.recovery_hint = recovery_hint
```

**Files to Modify:**
